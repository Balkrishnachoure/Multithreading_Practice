 We will create WebScraper project having  Multithreading Concepts : 


Key Components:

URL Queue: Maintain a queue of URLs to be scraped.

Thread Pool: Create a pool of worker threads to fetch and process URLs concurrently.

Web Scraper Function: Develop a function that fetches HTML content from a given URL and extracts relevant information.

Concurrency Control: Implement mechanisms like locks or semaphores to control access to shared resources (e.g., the URL queue) to avoid race conditions.

Result Storage: Store the scraped data in a suitable data structure (e.g., a list or database).

Logging: Add logging to track the progress and identify any issues during the scraping process.

Example Implementation Steps:
Create a list of URLs to scrape and add them to the URL queue.
Implement a function to fetch HTML content from a given URL.
Develop a function to extract relevant information from the HTML content.
Create a thread pool with a specified number of worker threads.
Implement a thread function that takes a URL from the queue, fetches and processes the content, and stores the result.
Add synchronization mechanisms to ensure safe access to shared resources.
Run the scraper and monitor the concurrent execution of threads.
